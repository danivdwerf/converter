# FTDConverter

The FTDConverter is a piece of software I wrote to make my work easier.
On <a href="http://freetimedev.com/extra/FreeCode/unityCode.php">my site</a> I
try to teach programming principles, syntax and give away free bits of code.
I wanted the code be highlighted, so it looks better and is easier to read.
<br />
<br />
The algorithm for detecting and highlighting code is done with plain c++,
The GUI stuff is done with the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/">GTKMM</a> library,
Checking for updates is done with an HTTPrequest with the <a href="https://pocoproject.org/">Poco library</a>.
The IDE I use is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> which is just a text editor.
