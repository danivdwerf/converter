# FTDConverter

The FTDConverter is a piece of software I wrote to make my work for my site easier.
On <a href="http://freetimedev.com/FreeCode/unityCode.php" target="blank">freetimedev.com</a> I show
try to teach programming principles, syntax and give away free bits of code.
I wanted it to be highlighted, so it looks better and is easier to understand.

<br />
The algorithm for detecting keywords and different types of code is done with plain c++,
The GUI stuff is done with the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/">GTKMM</a> library.
The IDE I use is <a href="https://atom.io/" target="blank">Atom</a> which is just a text editor.
