# FTDConverter

The FTDConverter is a piece of software I wrote to make my work for my site easier.
On <a href="http://www.freetimedev.com" target="blank">FreeTimeDev</a> I show
code and I wanted it to be with syntax highlighting so it looks better and is easier to understand.
It took me too long to write all the spans myself, so I decided to let my computer do it for me.
<br />
<br />
For the highlighting I used plain c++ and for the window handling I used the
<a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/">GTKMM</a> library.

The IDE I use is <a href="https://atom.io/" target="blank">Atom</a> which is just a text editor.
